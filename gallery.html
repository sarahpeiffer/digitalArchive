                            In her music video for "Judas", Lady Gaga portrays not only Judas, but also Jesus as members
                            of a rowdy biker gang vying for her heart. This portrayal of Jesus with all the accompanying
                            religious iconography led to outrage amongst some Catholic viewers.
                            Seen here, she portrays Jesus with a stylized, golden crown of thorns.


                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/14/lady-gaga-interview" class="mini-link">2011 interview with the Guardian</a>, Gaga states that "What matters is there was a time
                            – I'm going to cry – when nobody knew who we were, and all we had was each other and we only
                            created for each other, because it made us happy, and now that the whole world is watching,
                            we're still doing the same thing. So, no, I didn't pop out of nowhere and become a pop
                            singer. It's been a very real and arduous journey through Judas all the way to Jesus."
                            This dichotomy of Judas and Jesus is never as clear as in the lyrics of "Judas" as she sings
                            "Jesus is my virtue / And Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to"
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is not her only song featuring references to Jesus but due to the attention surrounding
                            the video, it was certainly the most debated. Other songs like "Bloody Mary" use the
                            crucifixion as inspiration for lyrics. Lyrics such as
                            "When Punk-tius comes to kill the King upon his throne" allude to Pontius Pilate and the
                            chorus repeats "I won't cry for you /
                            I won't crucify the things you do /
                            I won't cry for you /
                            See, when you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary" in reference to both the crucifixion and
                            Mary Magdelane.

This has allowed us to not only access, perceive, communicate, but also, to a considerable extent, to shape the reality we live in” <br> -Adrian-Mario Gellel in "Metaphors and Symbols in Popular Music as Exemplified in Katy Perry's Music and Music Videos" page 12

                       “Lady Gaga makes a conscious and strategic use of symbols, metaphors, and life experiences which she draws from a vast repertoire of cultural and symbolic baggage. She strategically chooses to employ religious symbols derived from myth, and those developed by pop culture during these past years, mostly through theatre, music, art, and fashion. The strategy is further enhanced by her ability to point to the potential of her work as symbolic resources for individuals. That is, she points to her audience that the symbols that she makes available to them may be used to generate meaning”<br> -Adrian-Mario Gellel in "Metaphors and Symbols in Popular Music as Exemplified in Katy Perry's Music and Music Videos" page 12

                        In Billboard’s track by track music review of Born This Way, the religious impact of “Judas” is minimized, as they write “Calm down folks, it's just a bad boy metaphor, not religious commentary” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471176/lady-gaga-born-this-way-track-by-track-review" class="mini-link">(Source)</a>. However, Gaga does not simply use Judas and the disciples as props for the video but incorporates this biblical story of betrayal and good versus evil into the song and her discussions of her faith and personal life.

                        Lady Gaga’s use of religious symbols in secular and often sexual contexts has generated significant public controversy and sparked debates over Catholic authority and modernity. Her incorporation of symbols such as the cross, rosary, nun’s habit, and crown of thorns into her seemingly secular, progressive art has been called blasphemous or even heretical. These critiques have come both from conservative religious groups and Catholic figures of authority.

                        This 2011 article by the Catholic League demonstrates the reaction of many Catholics news outlets to Lady Gaga's use of religious, and specifically Catholic symbolism in her work.

                        <br>
                        Religious reactions to Lady Gaga’s music demonstrate that “as conventional religious groups interact with popular culture in these ways—through representation in the media, adoption of its techniques, and rejection of its production—the dividing line between religion and popular culture blurs” (Chidester 32). While groups such as the Catholic League fight to keep religion apart from culture, it is an increasingly futile task. As they interact with Lady Gaga’s use of religion in popular media, religious groups delve further into the space they claim to condemn.

                        “Her prayer is the same as countless progressive Christians who recoil at the hypocritical judgment of fundamentalism yet still seek to follow Jesus.

                        make a difference. I never wanted to look pretty on stage and sing about something we've all
                        heard about before. I'd much rather write a song called Judas and talk about betrayal and
                        forgiveness and feeling misunderstood, and talk to the fans and figure out what it is society
                        needs. If I can be a leader, I will." -Lady Gaga quoted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/14/lady-gaga-interview" class="mini-link">2011 Guardian Interview</a>

                        Lady Gaga photographed visiting church service at Grandview United Methodist Church in Lancaster Pennsylvania (2014).

                        "But in the end, the best way to approach such flirtations with Catholicism may be not to consider whether they are offensive, but to ask whether the artist is using them purely for effect or as part of a personal dialogue. Gaga is no longer a practicing Catholic, but she does profess a Christian faith. For this reason, and also because her album is so fiercely passionate, preaching honest self-expression ardently if somewhat heretically, it seems clear that Gaga still cares about her God."
